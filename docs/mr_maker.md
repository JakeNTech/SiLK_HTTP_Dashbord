# mr_maker.py
This is the script that will generate the graphs, save them and return the paths of them in JSON. It's been seperated out to make it a bit easier on the eyes, there is litterly no other reason for this. I suspect at some point I might mess arround with threading to make it a bit faster but for the moment it's good enough...well I say this but testing on a laptop is very different to testing on the Pi.

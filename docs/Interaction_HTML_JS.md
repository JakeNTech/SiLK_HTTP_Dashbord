# Interaction.js
The job of this is to connect the backend to the HTTP interface, with the use of one HTML page.\
To achive this the main HTML page has:
```html
<div id="dynamic_page">
</div>
```
This is where all the content will be placed and changed using `interaction.js`. It impliments most of the functions seen in [docs/API_usage.md](https://github.com/JakeNTech/SiLK_HTTP_Dashbord/blob/main/docs/API_Usage.md).
